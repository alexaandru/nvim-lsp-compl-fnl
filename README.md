# nvim-lsp-compl-fnl

See the original [README](https://github.com/alexaandru/nvim-lsp-compl-fnl/blob/187652/README.md) for docs, details.

I will only document here what is different from that, starting with the reason this fork exist...

...and that is, for fun, of course! :-) I wanted to learn about internals of completion and
what better way than translating it to Fennel :-)

There is absolutely no reason to use this project, instead of the original.

Changes from original:

- removed support for snippets
